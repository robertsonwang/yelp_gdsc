       "   u'description': u\"My visit to Panas is all thanks to fate.  I actually tried to eat here the one time I visited the District before moving here, as I went to Urbana and was super unimpressed.  I remember walking up to Panas about ten minutes after they closed and being crushed.  I then came to the Icy Code opening, smelled the empanadas and thought I should make the trip back but didn't pay much attention to where it was.  Suddenly, I got off at the Dupont Metro one day and was roaming around trying to find some lunch.  As I walked up to Panas, both of these memories hit me, and I realized I had ended up back here.  So my friend and I finally stopped in, and I will definitely be back.\\n\\nWhen you walk into Panas, you walk up to the counter and order by letters of the things you want.  This comes in handy when you get the little pockets of joy because they print the letters on the dough so you know which one you are about to bite into!\\n\\nWe ordered the Empanadas Combo x4 ($9), which was supposed to come with chips and two drips, aka sauces.  The owner was super nice, though, and gave us an extra empanada and drip for free.  We tried the Chipotle Steak (CS), Chicken Pesto (CP), BBQ Sauce Chicken (CB), Pepperoni Empanada (PE), and were given a free Ham and Cheese (JQ).  The Chipotle Steak and BBQ Chicken were hands down the best empanadas, and these are the two must have ones.  The others were good but not special.  We also enjoyed the Salsa Verde, Aji, and Pimenton drips.  The Salsa Verde was mild but very good, and I loved the Pimenton the most with our empanadas.  The Aji tasted more mustard-y to me, which went with the ham and cheese but wasn't my top choice.  Once we finished stuffing ourselves with these pockets of joy, we ate the interestingly spiced chips, which were just OK, and we polished off a Mango Juice ($2.50).  It was very mango-y and delicious, and the price was right!\\n\\nThe shop was very warm on a cold day, and there are probably ten or so small tables to choose from.  The man who was taking care of us seemed to be the owner, and he was just the nicest.  Conversational, helpful, and generous.  It was just one of the only places that I have found in DC that delivered in all ways, which was really nice at a reasonable price.\\n\\nAll in all, fate may have kept bringing me to Panas, but their wonderful food and service will keep bringing me back.\",\n",

They do offer vegetarian ones too. The fruit drinks are made fresh to order and are very sweet and tasty. Very reasonably priced. It's a small place with not too many tables to sit at.

(I do wish it were easier to figure out which one is which though. I know you have the letters stamped on the edge, but how am I supposed to remember what PY and CA mean?) \\n\\nI particularly like the spinach with goat cheese and raisins (PY). The aji (yellow) sauce is my favorite. Their plantain chips are thinly sliced and not greasy--far and away better than the stuff in the bag at Trader Joe's. \\n\\nIf you're more than one person, order a canoa!

After all, it lived up to my expectations. \\n\\nThey have Very tasty empanadas with a great variety, both for vegetarians and meat lovers. You have the option to choose 3 ($7.5) or 4 ($9) with two sauces + plantain chips or go for big platter (6 or 8) to share, which comes with 4 sauces. I got beef with olives, chicken pesto, chicken mushroom, and eggplant. They were so damn hot so i burned my tongue. But when they got colder, they tasted better. \\n\\nThe location is casual but cute, especially the outdoor sitting. \\n\\nAlthough the empanadas are very tasty and fresh, i'm afraid they are half size the ones we are used to see. For me, with a small appetite, 3 or 4 is more than enough, but for a guy, I dont think 3-4 would make for a meal, so definitely you need a side. In that case you'll end up paying $15 for empanadas. I think they can be a good option if you want to share a fun snack with a friend or you want to oder for your parties.\\n\\nI think they need to knock down the prices or make the empanadas 1.5 times bigger.\",\n",

       "   u'description': u'I love and adore Panas!  It\\'s one of my absolute favorite counter service places in DC.  I can\\'t believe I haven\\'t reviewed it before!  I come here as often as I can, and I\\'ve made it a life goal to try every single empanada here at least once (they have over a dozen), but it\\'s sort of hard because I love the ones I\\'ve already had and keep getting them.  That\\'s a good problem to have though right?  \\n\\nThe empanadas are delicious, baked, warm pockets of goodness.  I\\'ve tried almost every variety at this point and my favorites are the Carne (traditional ground beef), the Pepperoni (it\\'s like a much better version of a hot pocket), and the Spinach (formerly known as the Popeye).  The two I don\\'t really like here are the corn and the chicken pesto, but that\\'s more of a personal preference thing.  The empanadas are the perfect size-- not too big, not too small-- and GREAT for practicing portion size.  I usually have 1 for a snack or 3 for a meal, but it depends on your appetite.  They feel kind of decadent but they\\'re small and baked, so they\\'re reasonsably healthy for what they are (notice that I did say REASONABLY) as long as you don\\'t have a million in one seating (tempting).  \\n\\nOverall, the food is a really solid 4.  The reason for the extra star is the amazing, above-and-beyond, service with a smile I always receive when I\\'m here.  They are just so SO nice here!  All the guys here (I\\'ve only ever had male cashiers) are super helpful and happy to give recommendations if it\\'s your first time.  One time, I got a take out order on a really hot day and I was standing there drinking from a water bottle I brought.  One of the guys there saw me and was like \"you should refill your water bottle at the drink station before you go back outside\".  It was a small suggestion, but it was super considerate and the kind of thing that makes a business standout.  I\\'m always happy when I leave here because they\\'re just so darn friendly.  \\n\\nTo me, going to Panas is like happiness, rainbows, and baked pastries all rolled into a cute little store right off of the Circle. :)\\n\\nTip: When I\\'m in MD and can\\'t go to Panas (sad), I get their empanadas at Balducci\\'s or Harris Teeter.  They stock a decent selection of their empanadas in local grocery stores all around the DMV.  They come in packs of 3 and they\\'re super convenient for snacks or meals.  I even eat them for breakfast!',\n",

It\\'s cool that they stamp the two letter code on the pastry of each one, so that people could figure out which was which. The plantain were also great. \\n\\nMy colleagues said there was an issue with picking up the order, but it was resolved without too much hassle. \\n\\nI\\'m looking forward to coming up to the store sometime and trying more flavors!',\n",
